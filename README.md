# QA-Hackathon_kudrytskaya
Repository for the participation in the QA-Hackathon. Consists of the test-cases, autotests and bug-reports.

pip install -r requirements.txt

TestReal: https://qahack.testrail.io/index.php?/projects/overview/1 
Found bugs are in the 'Bugs' folder.
Autotests were created only for bugs on the 1st API - I am a manual QA Engineer,
don't judge too strict.

It was interesting, thanks!
